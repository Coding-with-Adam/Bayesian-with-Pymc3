# Bayesian-with-Pymc3
This repository was created to help you familiarize yourself with Bayesian statistics and learn to use Pymc3. Bayesian statistics can be used for many processes such as: identifying a change point in a series of occurences, A/B testing, survival analysis and many more. 

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to let me know or join the pymc3 community at https://discourse.pymc.io/
